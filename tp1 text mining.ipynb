The governments own statistics reveal that children born into fatherless homes are more likely to drop out of school, more likely to have a history of unemployment, high chance of poverty, \\xa0and more likely to serve time in prison - the list goes on and on.\\n\\nWhen we look at the fact that 70% of black children will grow up in a fatherless home compared to 24% of \\xa0white children we see a number that begins to explain WHY black poverty and black crime is so high amongst blacks in America with 70% of black mothers on welfare.\\n\\nComplied with a dysfunctional gangster-rap culture that glorifies promiscuity, drug dealers the abuse of women and the power of the gun, we see a problem beginning to emerge and the reason for the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown begin to come clear.\\n\\nBlack Americans, a 13% minority, are doing 54% of the dying and probably 54% of the killing. That needs to be said. So now we have black culture of violence financed by the welfare system.\\xa0\\n\\n*CONCLUSION*\\n\\n*Like i said - there WILL BE \\xa0another \"race based case\" sooner or latter - in fact it will NEVER end.

If we as a race start to focus on solutions to a possible violent encounter with alternatives, then we can see progress with the police.\\n\\n4- You can't go out and protest and burn down your communities in retalitation against a police, this only supports a theory that Brown was a product of a violent environment.

Donald Trump, Star Parker, I hope you are aware of Peggy Hubbard's comments and address this issue as honestly as she has. There needs to be a seat at the table for Ms. Hubbard in the Trump campaign and administration.\\n\\nRace Mongers like Obama, Eric Holder, Pelosi, Reid, Jessie Jackson, Al Sharpton, the NAACP, the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Democrats (of all ethnicities, and on all levels of government), and the mainstream media have all conspired over the last 50 years to turn viable black communities into government-dependent ghettos by knowingly advancing a false narrative of systemic White (conservative) racism.\\n\\xa0\\nPerhaps their greatest accomplishment is the destruction of the black nuclear family. Seventy-two percent of black children are born to single mothers. \\xa0Why get married or limit the number of children you have, when Obama and the progressives will gladly extort taxpayer money to take care of you and your illegitimate children in exchange for guaranteed votes to keep themselves in power. \\xa0This master plan and policy insures generations of newly created disaffected and dysfunctional adults who will necessarily become democratic voters.\\n\\nIf the race hustlers mentioned above, reacted in the same way to black on black killings, they could go into those neighborhoods and with their power, wipe out all the gangs, minimize the drug use and give the community some real âhopeâ and âchange.â \\xa0It will never happen. \\xa0They need black communities to be dependent and feel hopeless in order to maintain their power and control. \\xa0They are living the good life off the backs of their own people, while deceiving them into thinking they care. \\xa0Just think â if these purveyors of lies and damn lies couldn't make race an issue over the past 40 years they would have to get ârealâ jobs like the rest of us.\",\n",

Statistically Cops kill more whites than blacks, yet whites see them as necessary because they save more lives than they cost, while places like Ferguson lose their minds.\\n2. Statistically 93% of murdered blacks are killed by other blacks, with whites consisting of 3% of the murderers and 4% being the other races.\\n3. Whites were enslaved by blacks first, and for over 150 years. This was when Europeans(the same race that started America and later enslaved Africans) began searching North Africa to establish trade of goods between natives. From the 1520s to the late 1600s whites were enslaved first. Later the tables turned. This boys and girls is called 'Karma.'\\n4. Statistically over 50% of murders in the US alone are from Blacks, despite them making up only 14.1% of the entire US population, while despite whites make up 63% of the US population they only make up 46% of the murders.\\n5. Whites make up 38% of welfare recipients with blacks making up 39%. This doesn't seem extreme until you realize that 39%(blacks) consists of that 14.1%, whith that 38%(whites) making up 63% of the US.

The governments own statistics reveal that children born into fatherless homes are more likely to drop out of school, more likely to have a history of unemployment, high chance of poverty, \\xa0and more likely to serve time in prison - the list goes on and on.\\n\\nWhen we look at the fact that 70% of black children will grow up in a fatherless home compared to 24% of \\xa0white children we see a number that begins to explain WHY black poverty and black crime is so high amongst blacks in America with 70% of black mothers on welfare.\\n\\nComplied with a dysfunctional gangster-rap culture that glorifies promiscuity, drug dealers the abuse of women and the power of the gun, we see a problem beginning to emerge and the reason for the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown begin to come clear.\\n\\nBlack Americans, a 13% minority, are doing 54% of the dying and probably 54% of the killing. That needs to be said. So now we have black culture of violence financed by the welfare system.\\xa0\\n\\n*CONCLUSION*\\n\\n*Like i said - there WILL BE \\xa0another \"race based case\" sooner or latter - in fact it will NEVER end.

The use of weapons includes pointing the weapon at someone.\\xa0\\n\\nThere are around 10-15 shots fired every year by the police and most of these are warning shots.There's approximately 1-2 shots fired at people per year by the police in all of Finland.\\xa0\\n\\nMany of these shots are shot at extremities and the deaths are quite rare, but there has been a case where a man was coming towards two police officers with a machete and was shot at first once in the leg. When he still was gripping the machete and waved it around from the ground the other officer fired once more, penetrating both legs. The man later died in the the hospital and the second police officer was found guilty of manslaughter and use of excessive force.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd this is in a country that has 3rd most guns in civilian hands in the world and is at 10th position in deaths caused by firearms.\\xa0\\n\\nBut unlike in America, our police enjoys a high amount of public trust, placing at 5th most trustworthy profession, behind firemen and doctors.\\xa0\\n\\nMaybe there could be something gained if american cops took some pointers from other countries police procedures instead of playing cowboys.\\n\\nEDIT: Finnish police wear a blue overall that is resistant to knife cuts when on duty and put on cut-resistant gloves when on a call. This gives them more ways to deal with threats.\\n\\nhttp://kuvat.uusisuomi.fi/sites/default/files/imagecache/artikkelikuva_std/kuvat/vicdan0002.jpg\\ufeff\\n\\nI is a copy of a text that i wrote on another TYT video, because the issue is the same.\",\n",

There needs to be a seat at the table for Ms. Hubbard in the Trump campaign and administration.\\n\\nRace Mongers like Obama, Eric Holder, Pelosi, Reid, Jessie Jackson, Al Sharpton, the NAACP, the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Democrats (of all ethnicities, and on all levels of government), and the mainstream media have all conspired over the last 50 years to turn viable black communities into government-dependent ghettos by knowingly advancing a false narrative of systemic White (conservative) racism.\\n\\xa0\\nPerhaps their greatest accomplishment is the destruction of the black nuclear family. Seventy-two percent of black children are born to single mothers. \\xa0Why get married or limit the number of children you have, when Obama and the progressives will gladly extort taxpayer money to take care of you and your illegitimate children in exchange for guaranteed votes to keep themselves in power. \\xa0This master plan and policy insures generations of newly created disaffected and dysfunctional adults who will necessarily become democratic voters.\\n\\nIf the race hustlers mentioned above, reacted in the same way to black on black killings, they could go into those neighborhoods and with their power, wipe out all the gangs, minimize the drug use and give the community some real âhopeâ and âchange.â \\xa0It will never happen. \\xa0They need black communities to be dependent and feel hopeless in order to maintain their power and control. \\xa0They are living the good life off the backs of their own people, while deceiving them into thinking they care. \\xa0Just think â if these purveyors of lies and damn lies couldn't make race an issue over the past 40 years they would have to get ârealâ jobs like the rest of us.\",\n",
